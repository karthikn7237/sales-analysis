# sales-analysis
The Walmart Superstore has a vast amount of sales data, including information on products, customers, stores, and transactions. The main objective is to extract meaningful insights from this data to analyse the overall sales of walmart superstore.

  As a first step, I cleaned up the given data to remove the null values and blank cells.
  
  And as a next step, I imported the data into Power BI. And I chose to import the entire dataset into the PowerBI interface.
  
  After importing the data, I created a data model to define the relationships between the different tables. I used Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to   create the data model.
  
  I used Power BI's built-in visualizations to create various vizualizations. I created a compelling and interactive visualizations using Power BI,   
  including charts, graphs, and dashboards that effectively communicate insights.
